# sql-challenge

Used SQL and Postgres to query data from a Pewlett Hackard data consisting of 6 CSVs from employees in the 1980s and 1990s. CSVs contained employee number, first and last names, employee sex, birth date, hire date, salaries, manager information, and department information. Made multiple queries into the information and included an ERD diagram.
